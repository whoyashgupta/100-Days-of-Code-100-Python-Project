## 💡 About the project
> Me, Yash Gupta. I am challenging myself to complete the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. Over the course of 100 days, spending one hour each day, I aim to learn how to build a project using Python. <br><br>
Today, on 04/24/2022, I am starting the challenge with only the ability to write "Hello World" in the language. <br> If I am unable to complete a challenge on any given day due to time constraints or other reasons, that challenge will roll over to the following day. This means that I will be spending a total of 100 non-consecutive days learning Python." 😂
